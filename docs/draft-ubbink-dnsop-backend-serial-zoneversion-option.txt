                 DNS Backend Serial Zone Version Option
        draft-ubbink-dnsop-backend-serial-zoneversion-option-00

Abstract

   The DNS Backend Serial Zone Version Opion is a way to get information
   about the version of a DNS zone in the backend.  For example when a
   DNSSEC signer for a zone generates a new SOA serial, because it has
   created new RRSIG records, the original data has not changed, but
   this is not visible to anyone looking at the zone via DNS.  This
   document will make it possible to show the zone information which is
   the source of the presented data.

2.  Introduction

   The DNS Backend Serial Zone Version Option is a way to get
   information about the version of a DNS zone in the backend.  For
   example when a DNSSEC signer for a zone generates a new SOA serial,
   because it has created new RRSIG records, the original data has not
   changed, but this is not visible to anyone looking at the zone.  This
   document makes it possible to retreive the backend version that is
   the source of data in the DNS response.

3.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Relation to the ZONEVERSION option

   This document extends the original DNS Zone version Option
   [!@RFC9660] to include an extra ZONEVERSION type.

5.  The backend serial in the zone

   To make the backend serial available in the ZONEVERSION, it must be
   available in the zone itself.  Because creating an out of bound
   solution would be to much work.  This document defines a label where
   the backend serial will be available to be used in the ZONEVERSION.

   The backend serial will be published in a _backend-version label
   under the zone apex.

   For example:

   _backend-version.example.nl IN TXT "2025101099"

   The setting of the value of the _backend-version label is out of
   scope for this document.  The RDATA is not limited to a 32-bit
   number, like the SOA-SERIAL.  It can be any string.

   There MUST only be one _backend-version label.

6.  The backend serial ZONEVERSION type

   This document defines a new ZONEVERSION option TYPE, which can be
   constructed from RDATA in the zone.

   The mnemonic for this type is "BACKEND-SERIAL".

   The VERSION value for the BACKEND-SERIAL type MUST come from the
   RDATA of the _backend-version label in the zone.  Unless the software
   already knows the backend serial, then it SHOULD use that.  If there
   are multiple _backend-version labels at the zone apex, these MUST all
   be ignored.

7.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   TODO

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  ZONEVERSION TYPE value

   This document defines a new item for the ZONEVERSION TYPE option,
   entitled BACKEND-SERIAL (see Section 6), and assigns a value of <TBD>
   from the ZONEVERSION TYPE Values space:

          +==================+================+=================+
          | ZONEVERSION TYPE | Mnemonic       | Reference       |
          +==================+================+=================+
          | <TBD>            | BACKEND-SERIAL | [this document] |
          +------------------+----------------+-----------------+

                                  Table 1

8.2.  _backend-version Underscore Name

   Per [RFC8552], IANA is requested to add the following entries to the
   "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry:

             +=========+==================+=================+
             | RR Type | _NODE NAME       | Reference       |
             +=========+==================+=================+
             | TXT     | _backend-version | [this document] |
             +---------+------------------+-----------------+

                                 Table 2
